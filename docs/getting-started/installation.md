# Installation

## For Users

Because the distribution archive is quite large (8GB), it cannot be hosted using GitHub releases.

We will set up public hosting in the future. For now, contact us through the appropriate channels.

The downloaded archive file contains all required files for running the application. **Textum does not require an internet connection and sends no data to external services**.

**System Requirements**:
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for bigger workloads)
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- ~20GB disk space
- Linux or Windows 10/11

Extract the archive and run the executable. See [Quick Start](quick-start.md) to begin.

Note that the executable has to be run from inside the folder, otherwise it cannot find its application files. Creating a desktop shortcut is possible though:
- In the extracted folder, right-click on textum.exe
- Select `Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)`
- This will create a desktop shortcut, allowing you to start the application from the desktop
- Notably, starting Textum from the Windows start menu is not supported
